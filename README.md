The app made by AI
Took me kindaaa a long time to fix bugs (asking ai for fixing them cuz i dont know how to code bruh)
and the info about keybinds, combinations of them is in "StaminaBarInfo.py" File, just open it and read if you need keybinds info
Old stamina bar sucks so u can not even open it lol.
Also the final best version is the most peakest peak stamina bar version, so just use it instead other ones ;)
The idea of stamina bar is from game "PEAK" on steam
The point of making it was for um... when i get like "peak player plushie" then i will like play peak irl with this plushie :D
I think ai did very good job, like fr.
Maybe will update the look of things later (graphics)
Tell me if it has any bugs here:
